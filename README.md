# NLP_Na-veBayesClassification
Implementing the Na√Øve Bayes classifier for movie review classification. I this project, I wrote 2 scripts: NB.py and PreProcess.py. PreProcess.py takes the training/test directory containing movie reviews. Performs pre-processing on each file then NB.py takes the pre-processed data and predicts if the file should be positive or negative review on test folder.
Run the NB.py script, running PreProcess.py wont give any output
